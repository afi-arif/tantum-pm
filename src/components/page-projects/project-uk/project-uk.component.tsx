                    <p>An above market price sale was just what the doctor ordered for one disgruntled homeowner. The client was midway through an external extension project, but had been let down by contractors.</p>
                    <p>As is sadly commonplace with many extension projects, the client’s contractors deviated from their original plan. This resulted in going over budget, and a breach of planning regulations. The extension had come to a standstill.</p>
                    <p>We revised both the external extension and internal design to bring the project back in line with regulations. Plans were resubmitted to local authorities to rectify the previous contractors’ mistakes. The work went ahead as planned.</p>
                    <p>The extension was soon back on track, and was completed ahead of schedule. We recommended our most qualified specialists and tradesmen, who delivered superior quality within the client’s budget. As part of our ongoing support, we held regular meetings with progress updates.</p>
                    <p>When the renovation was finished, the owner decided to put the property on the market. We’re delighted to say it sold for above market value. More importantly, we restored the owner’s faith in project management teams, delivering high quality from start to finish.</p>
